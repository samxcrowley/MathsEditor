'Expression' type - Operations (2 args) and Terms (1 arg)

    - Operation:
    - has two Expression objects as the 'operators'
        - e.g.
            - Addition Operation
                - Expression one is another addition (x + 5)
                - Expression two is sqrt(5)
                - final result is    x + 5 + sqrt(5)
                
            - Subtraction operation
                
            - Fraction operation
                - terms to be divided
                
            - Multiplication operation:
                - has coefficient and Expression
                    - e.g. 5 and x -> 5x
                    - e.g. 5 and (x + 4) -> 5(x + 4)
                    
            - Index operation:
                - Expression and index
                    - e.g. x and 2 -> x^2
    
    - Square root term:
        - Expression to be square rooted
            - e.g. 25 -> sqrt(25)
        
    - Variable term:
        - Single variable
            - e.g. x or y or a or b or c ...
        
    - Constant term:
        - Single number
            - e.g. 1, 2, 3 ...
