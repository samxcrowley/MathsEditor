# MathsEditor

A simple 'Maths Editor' to display and calculate mathematical expressions given by the user. Runs in the browser with the p5.js library.

Takes in input from the user in Infix notation and displays in a more human-readable format on the canvas. Can also calculate the result of expressions, where appropriate.
