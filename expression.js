/*

Expression is the super class from which all mathematical objects derive.

There are two types of expressions; Operations and Terms.

Note that all expressions take in other expressions as their value(s), meaning
one expression class would represent the parent 'node' of an entire mathematical
expression containing many smaller expressions.
